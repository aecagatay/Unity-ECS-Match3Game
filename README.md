# Unity-ECS-Match3Game
A simple and experimental Matc3 game project which utilizes Unity's ECS libraries and approaches.

**All the animations, audio, fonts, prefabs, scene elements, effect files, manager files, and sprites are taken form the tutorial on https://www.raywenderlich.com/673-how-to-make-a-match-3-game-in-unity** 

**The SpriteInstanceRenderer was adopted from Paul Lavender Jones (@paullj): https://github.com/paullj/unity-ecs-instanced-sprite-renderer**
